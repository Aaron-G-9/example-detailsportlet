# Example uPortal Portlet

### Purpose
> The purpose of this project is to give Oakland uPortal developers an easy to understand and simple first portlet to look at. It displays one's name, one's pidm, and one's email.  
> Additionally, this portlet has a very simple implementation of preferences. Switching to the EditController will allow the user to save whether or not the pidm should be displayed.

### Documentation
> Documentation specifically for Oakland Student Developers can be found [here](https://code.oakland.edu/mysail-development/uportal/tree/documentation).  

> For others, [spring documentation](https://spring.io/docs), [portlet docuementation](https://portals.apache.org/pluto/portlet-2.0-apidocs/), and [uPortal documentation](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/UPM40/Home) can all be found on their respective sites.
